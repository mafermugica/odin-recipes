## 📋 Project Overview
The goal was to build a basic recipe website consisting of a main index page and several linked recipe pages. The focus was strictly on HTML, ensuring semantic correctness and proper directory management without relying on styling.

### Key Features:
- **Main Landing Page:** An index linking to various recipes.
- **Recipe Pages:** Detailed pages containing descriptions, ingredients, and steps.
- **Media Integration:** Use of images with proper `alt` attributes.
- **Navigation:** Implementation of relative links and anchor tags.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Semantic HTML5:** Usage of tags like `<h1>` through `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<strong>` to create a meaningful document structure.
* **File Paths:** Management of relative paths (current directory vs. parent directory) to link pages and images correctly.
* **Git Workflow:** Atomic commits and proper repository initialization.
* **Clean Code:** Indentation and commenting best practices.
